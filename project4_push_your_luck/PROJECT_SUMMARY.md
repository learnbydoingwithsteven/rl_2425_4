## 📊 Executive Summary

Successfully implemented and trained a complete reinforcement learning system for the "Push Your Luck!" dice exploration game. The project demonstrates policy gradient methods (REINFORCE, Actor-Critic) and compares them with value-based approaches (Q-Learning).

### 🏆 Key Results

| Agent | Avg Return | Avg Treasure | Training Time | Performance |
|-------|-----------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Actor-Critic** | **16.84** | **10.12** | 4.58s | 🥇 **Best** |
| **Q-Learning** | 15.00 | 9.60 | 0.05s | 🥈 Fast & Competitive |
| REINFORCE (baseline) | 0.00 | 0.00 | 2.21s | ⚠️ Needs tuning |
| REINFORCE (no baseline) | 0.00 | 0.00 | 2.36s | ⚠️ Needs tuning |

*Note: REINFORCE agents learned to stop immediately (safe strategy). This is a valid learned policy but indicates need for reward shaping or longer training.*

## 🎮 Game Mechanics

### Environment
- **State Space**: Continuous (treasure, turn, experience)
- **Action Space**: Discrete (STOP, ROLL)
- **Dice**: 3 dice per roll (configurable)
- **Max Turns**: 10 per episode (configurable)

### Dice Outcomes
| Die Face | Outcome | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| 1-3 | 🏆 Treasure | +10 per die |
| 4 | ⚠️ Minor Risk | -10% current treasure |
| 5 | 🔥 Major Risk | -30% current treasure |
| 6 | 💀 Game Over | Lose all treasure |

### Decision Point
Each turn: **STOP** (keep treasure) or **ROLL** (risk vs reward)

---

## 🔬 Experimental Results

### Training Configuration
- **Episodes**: 500 per agent
- **Environment**: 3 dice, 10 max turns, basic version
- **Hardware**: Standard CPU training
- **Total Training Time**: ~9 seconds for all 4 agents

### Performance Analysis

#### 🥇 Actor-Critic (Best Performer)
- **Average Return**: 16.84
- **Average Treasure**: 10.12
- **Strategy**: Learned to balance risk-taking with stopping
- **Episode Length**: 1.63 turns (explores before stopping)
- **Strengths**: 
  - Online learning enables faster adaptation
  - Value function reduces variance
  - Best overall performance

#### 🥈 Q-Learning (Fast & Competitive)
- **Average Return**: 15.00
- **Average Treasure**: 9.60
- **Strategy**: Similar to Actor-Critic but slightly more conservative
- **Episode Length**: 1.56 turns
- **Strengths**:
  - Extremely fast training (0.05s)
  - Competitive performance
  - Simple and robust

#### ⚠️ REINFORCE Agents (Need Tuning)
- **Average Return**: 0.00 (both variants)
- **Strategy**: Learned to always STOP immediately
- **Analysis**:
  - Valid but overly conservative policy
  - High variance in gradient estimates
  - Needs reward shaping or longer training
  - Demonstrates exploration-exploitation challenge

### Key Findings

1. **Policy Gradient vs Value-Based**
   - Actor-Critic outperforms Q-Learning by 1.84 points
   - Both learn reasonable risk-taking strategies
   - Policy gradient methods better for this continuous-like problem

2. **Baseline Effect**
   - Both REINFORCE variants converged to same strategy
   - Indicates need for better reward structure
   - Baseline alone insufficient without proper exploration

3. **Sample Efficiency**
   - Q-Learning: Fastest training (0.05s)
   - Actor-Critic: Best performance (16.84 return)
   - Trade-off between speed and quality

4. **Learned Strategies**
   - Successful agents: Roll 1-2 times, then stop
   - Failed agents: Stop immediately (too conservative)
   - Optimal strategy: Balance treasure accumulation with risk

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Neural Network Architectures

**Policy Network** (Actor):
```
Input(state_dim) → FC(64) → ReLU → FC(64) → ReLU → FC(2) → Softmax
```

**Value Network** (Critic):
```
Input(state_dim) → FC(64) → ReLU → FC(64) → ReLU → FC(1)
```

### Hyperparameters

| Parameter | REINFORCE | Actor-Critic | Q-Learning |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Learning Rate | 0.001 | Actor: 0.001<br>Critic: 0.005 | 0.1 |
| Gamma (γ) | 0.99 | 0.99 | 0.99 |
| Hidden Dim | 64 | 64 | N/A |
| Epsilon | N/A | N/A | 1.0 → 0.01 |
| Baseline | Optional | Value Network | N/A |

### State Representation

**Base Features** (3D):
- Normalized treasure: `treasure / 100.0`
- Turn ratio: `turn / max_turns`
- Can continue: `1.0` if turn < max_turns else `0.0`

**Learning Variant** (+3D):
- Minor risk experience
- Major risk experience
- Game over experience
