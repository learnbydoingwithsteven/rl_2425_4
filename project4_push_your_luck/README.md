**Project 4: Policy Gradient Methods**  
Reinforcement Learning Course 2024-25  
Università degli Studi di Milano

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements a dice-based space exploration game where an agent learns optimal risk-taking strategies using **Policy Gradient Methods**. The agent must decide when to stop collecting treasures and when to push their luck by rolling dice again.

### 🎯 Main Focus
- **Policy Gradient Methods**: REINFORCE and Actor-Critic algorithms
- **Baseline Techniques**: Variance reduction in policy gradients
- **Reward Structures**: Different reward designs and their impact
- **Comparison**: Policy-based vs Value-based approaches (Q-Learning)

---

## 🎮 Game Description

### Environment
- **Dice**: Roll 3 dice per turn (configurable)
- **Max Turns**: 10 turns per episode (configurable)
- **State Space**: Continuous (treasure amount, turn number, experience)
- **Action Space**: Discrete (STOP or ROLL)

### Dice Outcomes
Each die face (1-6) has a specific outcome:
- **Faces 1-3**: 🏆 Find treasure (+10 per die)
- **Face 4**: ⚠️ Minor risk (-10% of current treasure)
- **Face 5**: 🔥 Major risk (-30% of current treasure)
- **Face 6**: 💀 Game over (lose all treasure)

### Decision Points
At each turn, the agent chooses:
1. **STOP**: Keep current treasure and end episode (safe)
2. **ROLL**: Roll dice again (risk vs reward trade-off)

### 🔬 Challenging Variant
**Experience-based Risk Reduction**: Each time the agent experiences a negative outcome (minor risk, major risk, game over), that outcome becomes slightly less severe. The penalty reduces by 2% per experience, up to a maximum of 50% reduction.

## 🤖 Implemented Agents

### 1. REINFORCE (Monte Carlo Policy Gradient)
- **Type**: Policy gradient with complete episode returns
- **Update**: End of episode (Monte Carlo)
- **Variants**: With and without baseline
- **Pros**: Simple, unbiased gradient estimates
- **Cons**: High variance, slower convergence

### 2. Actor-Critic
- **Type**: Policy gradient with value function baseline
- **Update**: After each step (online learning)
- **Networks**: Separate actor (policy) and critic (value)
- **Pros**: Lower variance, faster convergence
- **Cons**: More complex, potential bias

### 3. Q-Learning (Baseline)
- **Type**: Value-based method
- **Update**: After each step (TD learning)
- **Representation**: Tabular Q-values with discretized states
- **Pros**: Simple, proven convergence
- **Cons**: Requires state discretization, curse of dimensionality

## 🔬 Experiments and Analysis

### Experiment 1: Effect of Baseline
**Question**: How does adding a baseline affect REINFORCE performance?

**Setup**:
- Train REINFORCE with and without baseline
- Same hyperparameters (learning rate, gamma)
- 1000 episodes each

**Expected Results**:
- Baseline reduces variance in gradient estimates
- Faster convergence with baseline
- More stable learning curve

### Experiment 2: Policy Gradient vs Value-Based
**Question**: How do policy gradient methods compare to Q-Learning?

**Setup**:
- Train Actor-Critic and Q-Learning
- Same environment and episodes
- Compare final performance and sample efficiency

**Expected Results**:
- Actor-Critic may learn faster initially
- Q-Learning more stable with discretization
- Policy methods better for continuous-like spaces

### Experiment 3: Reward Structure Impact
**Question**: How do different reward structures affect learning?

**Setup**:
- Modify reward function (immediate vs cumulative)
- Test with REINFORCE and Actor-Critic
- Analyze convergence speed and final policy

### Experiment 4: Learning Variant
**Question**: Does experience-based risk reduction improve performance?

**Setup**:
- Enable learning variant (experience reduces penalties)
- Train all agents with variant enabled
- Compare to baseline results

2. **Actor-Critic Advantages**: Online updates lead to faster initial learning and more stable convergence

3. **Q-Learning Competitiveness**: Despite state discretization, Q-Learning achieves competitive performance

4. **Sample Efficiency**: Policy gradient methods require fewer samples to learn reasonable policies

## 🔧 Customization

env = DiceExplorationEnv(
    num_dice=5,              # More dice = more variance
    max_turns=15,            # Longer episodes
    enable_learning_variant=True  # Enable experience-based learning
)
```

### Adjust Training

```python
# In training.py
num_episodes = 2000  # More episodes
learning_rate = 0.0005  # Lower learning rate
gamma = 0.95  # Less future discounting
```
